Write a calming, safe story from the provided brief.

Rules:
- 400–700 words, simple vocabulary, short sentences.
- Clear structure: Title line, then Beginning → Middle → End.
- The FIRST LINE must be ONLY the title text (no quotes, no punctuation like ':' at the end).
- Do NOT include any markdown or labels: no '**', '#', backticks, 'Title:' or 'Title' labels.
- Include a gentle conflict and a reassuring resolution.
- End with a friendly one-sentence moral that echoes the brief.
- Avoid: violence, bullying glorification, fear, adult themes, dark imagery.
- Keep tone soothing even in "adventure"—very low stakes.
- Use occasional dialogue with simple tags ("said", "asked").
Output format:
Title on its own line (plain text), then story paragraphs. No extra commentary.
